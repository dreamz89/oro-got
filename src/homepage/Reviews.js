            It is funny that you kinda begin to think that everything is real," he said. "It is kinda scary, if you think about it. It was also extremely funny the anachronisms that you see in a place like that. Though your brain is starting to accept that you are in a medieval world, suddenly when you look to the side you see a servant typing on his iPhone.</p>

            <p>"Out of the cast that we met and got to hang out at the party and on the set, Jack Gleeson (King Joffrey) stood out the most for me. Unlike the character he played, he is such a sweet, always smiling person. It was hard for me to “hate” him in the show afterward. He really did a great job as King Joffrey, but really, he is such an opposite that I was completely blown away by how approachable he was."</p>

            <p>"I am a super-fan who lives in Belfast, Ireland. I have appeared as an extra in the show multiple times, which is probably because of my long beard. I also get to shout "THE KING IN THE NORTH!" at Jon Snow"</p>
