This project started out as a technical take-home project for an interview. The specifications are as below, and have been met in the first version.
The theme was inspired by the Game of Thrones making-of videos that I was watching when I received the technical specifications.
I will be working on improvements to expand on the project in my free time to showcase more of my skills and creativity.

# Project Specifications:
1)	Create a simple web app with any back-end (example NodeJS or Firebase etc) of your choice,

a)	using React as the framework; and <br>
b)	based on Material Design (preferably using components) <br>

that: <br>
I.	Allows a user to register for an account <br>
II.	After registering for an account, server create this account in any DB of your choice, and issue a random password. <br>
III.	User login using the login_id he registered with and the random password issued by the server <br>

Bonus: The UI can be localised to English and another language (e.g. Chinese, Melayu, etc.)
